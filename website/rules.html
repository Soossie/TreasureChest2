                    and the right airport where the treasure is hidden. Along the way, you will encounter wise men and
                    advice guys who can give you more money and motivation to continue your journey. Try to travel
                    wisely â€“ if you run out of money before finding the treasure, your game is over.
                </p>

                <h2 class="header2">The goal</h2>
                <p>The goal of the game is to find the treasure chest, which holds a reward. You must first find the
                    correct country and then the correct airport where the treasure is located.
                </p>

                <h2 class="header2">How to play</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Start the game</b> by pressing the Start New Game button. You will receive money for buying
                        plane tickets, the amount depends on the difficulty level.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Find the correct country</b> where the treasure is located. You can see the airport name,
                        distance, ticket cost and CO2 consumption by pressing the buttons on the map. The colors of the
                        buttons are
                        explained in the box next to the map. Green buttons mean you have enough money to travel. If the
                        button is dark green, you have already visited that airport. Red buttons mean you don't have
                        enough money. A dark red button indicates you have already visited that airport.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>You can travel</b> to your chosen airport <b>by pressing the Fly button</b>, which you find
                        by clicking
                        the map buttons. If you wish, you can get a hint to find the correct country.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Each flight costs money</b> and generates CO2 emissions. You can track your consumption in
                        the
                        Game Status table.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>You may encounter advice guys</b> during your journey, who will give you motivational advice
                        and money.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>When you find the correct country</b>, your task is to find the airport within the country
                        where
                        the treasure is located. You proceed the same way as with international flights, but domestic
                        flights are more expensive. Short flights are relatively more expensive than long flights.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>In the treasure country, you may encounter wise men.</b> If you wish, you can answer a
                        question
                        to win money if you answer correctly. However, the wise men are greedy and will ask for money
                        before giving you the question. If you answer wrong, you lose the money to the wise men.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>You win the game</b> when you find the correct airport where the treasure is located. If you
                        run
                        out of money before finding the treasure, you lose.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h1>About the game</h1>
                <p>Treasure Chest 2.0 is a second iteration of the infamous hit game Treasure Chest. The game builds on
                    the first version, so the concept remains the same in the updated version – the player receives a
                    mysterious envelope containing a golden key and a treasure map. The goal of the game is to find the
                    treasure chest, which holds a reward. Read more on the Rules-page.
                </p>
                <p>The game has a few changes compared to the previous version. An advice guy has been added to the
                    game: when the player travels to an airport where they meet the advice guy, they receive advice and
                    money based on the difficulty level.
                </p>
                <p>The update obviously includes visual enhancements – the game is played in a browser, and the user
                    moves from one airport to another by clicking buttons on the map, using the mouse and keyboard as
                    controls. In the previous version, the user played the game interactively using only the keyboard.
                    A carbon dioxide calculator has been added to the game: each flight generates CO2 emissions, and the
                    consumed CO2 is updated on the screen after the flight. If the player exceeds the specified CO2
                    limit, 1,000 kg, the price of plane tickets increases by 20 %.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, the game's code has been updated and organized more cleanly using object-oriented
                    programming. The game utilizes a map service and an API. The advice given by the advice guy is
                    fetched from the external data source when the player travels to the advice guy’s airport.
                </p>

                <h2 class="header2">Story behind the game</h2>
                <p>The game was developed as part of the Software 1 and 2 courses, and it adheres to the defined
                    constraints: the game is played in a browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages. The logic is
                    executed in Python as a backend service with an API. Communication between the backend and browser
                    is via API requests and JSON responses. The backend uses a relational database. The game has a clear
                    goal, considers sustainability, and is suitable for young users (K12).
                </p>
